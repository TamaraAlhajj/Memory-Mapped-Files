## Purpose  ##

To implement a mmap write and read programs such that, <br />
the former write n random integers to the Ô¨Åle <br />
and the latter reads and prints all integers. <br />

## Getting Started ##

From working directory, compile and run by simply typing make.<br />
n is an argument to both programs; it must be a positive integer.<br />
This will run a test for the programs where n = 10.<br />
Following this the erroneous cases will be tested and print output.<br />
<br />
To run a custom test type:
```
make all
./mmap-write afile anInt
./mmap-read afile anInt
```

To clean:
```
make clean
```
